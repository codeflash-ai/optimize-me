Async examples package containing intentionally unoptimized async code.

This package demonstrates common async anti-patterns that CodeFlash can optimize:
- Sequential operations that should be concurrent
- Improper use of asyncio primitives
- Blocking operations in async contexts
- Poor resource management
- Inefficient database patterns
- Bad web scraping practices
